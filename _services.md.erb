# Services

The services offered by the TerraPay system can be broadly classified into:

* Remit to Mobile
* Remit to Bank

## Remit to Mobile

This service enables the sender to instantly send money to a beneficiary's mobile number. The money is credited through a payment instrument associated with the beneficiary's mobile number. This could be a mobile network operator wallet, a mobile money operator wallet, a bank wallet or a bank account which is mapped to the mobile number. TerraPay automatically routes the transaction through the available payment instrument.

A sender can initiate the money transfer from a mobile wallet, bank account or cash over the counter. This depends on the interfaces provided by the sending partner.
